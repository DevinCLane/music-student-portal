Dev workflow:

Next steps:

- Student management routes and controllers got updated: update views for student management routes/controllers to make sure that these features work end to end: create student, view student page, etc.
- Continue to lesson management routes, build out controllers:

// Handles teacher's lesson management
module.exports = {
getNewLessonForm,
createLesson,
editLesson,
deleteLesson
}
then build out the views to test all these features. teacher can create a lesson plan for a student, view the create lesson plan form, etc.

- then teacher can edit lesson and delete lesson
- then teacher can edit student and delete student
- then student can log in as student
- student can view dashboard with lessons
- student can view individual lessons

bigger picture:

- reorganize the views to match the routes organiation? everything a teacher does is under teacher

    - delete all the students in the datebase because they have LessonPlans not lessons
